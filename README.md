# Ai_captiongenerator
🖼️ AI Caption Generator



Welcome to the AI Caption Generator project! This Python-based application is designed to automatically generate descriptive captions for images using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

📌 Project Overview


This project leverages computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze an image and generate a relevant textual caption. It's a simplified version of how applications like Google Photos or Instagram generate automatic photo captions.

🚀 Features

Upload any image and receive a descriptive caption.
Utilizes deep learning models (CNN for image feature extraction + LSTM for caption generation).
Easy to run and experiment with.
Open-source and extendable.

🧠 Technologies Used:

Python
TensorFlow / Keras (for building the neural network)
OpenCV / PIL (for image processing)
NumPy / Pandas
NLTK / SpaCy (optional: for preprocessing)

Pre-trained models (like InceptionV3 or VGG16 for feature extraction)

⚙️ How It Works


1.Image Processing:

The image is passed through a pre-trained CNN (like InceptionV3).

Image features are extracted and transformed into a vector.

2.Caption Generation:

The image vector is fed into an LSTM-based language model.

The model predicts a sequence of words to form a meaningful caption.

🛠️ How to Run


1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Rushdagangapatla/Ai_captiongenerator.git
cd Ai_captiongenerator
2.Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Run the script:

python ai_captiongenerator.py
4.Upload an image and see the generated caption!

📝 Note: You may need to download pre-trained models manually or via code.
